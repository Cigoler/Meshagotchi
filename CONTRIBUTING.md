## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on one clear change at a time.
- Use descriptive commit messages (so history is easy to follow).
- If you’re adding a new behaviour, try to document it in the README or comments.
- For major features, open a discussion or feature request issue first to align with others.

## 🧪 Testing

Whenever possible:

- Test changes on actual Meshtastic-compatible hardware (HELTEC V3, M5Stack, ThinkNode, etc).
- Include screenshots, logs, or animations showing how the feature looks/works.
- If it’s only simulation code (Python/Node-RED), try to provide sample inputs/outputs.

## 📣 Community & Support

- Open Issues for bugs or feature requests.
- Use Discussions to share ideas, artwork, and enclosure designs.
- Join the Meshtastic community to connect with other LoRa tinkerers.

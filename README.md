# Meshagotchi

**Meshagotchi** is a Tamagotchi-inspired companion that lives inside your Meshtastic network.  
It’s a little creature that **feeds on discovering new nodes, gets upset when neighbours disappear, and thrives when the mesh is alive**.

Think of it as a playful way to visualise mesh health — or as your own pocket-sized radio spirit.

## ✨ Features (planned)
- 🎉 **Node Discovery as Food** – every new node your device encounters makes Meshagotchi happier.  
- 😢 **Loneliness** – when nodes leave or the mesh goes quiet, your Meshagotchi sulks or goes to sleep.  
- 📈 **Evolution** – consistent mesh activity helps Meshagotchi “grow” or change personality.  
- 🎨 **Custom Animations** – OLED/e-ink displays show moods, expressions, and idle behaviours.  
- 🛠️ **DIY Friendly** – designed for Meshtastic-compatible hardware (HELTEC, M5Stack, ThinkNode, etc).  
- 🔌 **MQTT / API Hooks** – optional integration with Node-RED, Home Assistant, or your own scripts.

## 🛠️ Hardware Ideas
- ESP32-based Meshtastic node (e.g. HELTEC V3, M5Stack Core, ThinkNode).  
- Small screen (OLED or e-ink).  
- Optional buzzer or RGB LED for extra feedback.  
- 3D-printed enclosure to house the “pet” in a Tamagotchi-like form factor.

## 🚧 Project Status
Meshagotchi is in **early development**.  
The repo will grow to include:
- Firmware / scripts for ESP32 devices  
- Art assets for the Meshagotchi creature  
- 3D print models for enclosures  
- Integration examples with MQTT, Node-RED, and Home Assistant  

Contributions, ideas, and experiments are very welcome!
